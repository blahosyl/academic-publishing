### Flow

The client heavily preferred a continuous website rather than separate clickable pages, citing results that show that user engagement drastically decreases after each time a user has to click.

In accordance with this, the website consists of 3, visually separate sections that can be continuously scrolled through:

1. Problems & Solutions
2. About/Credentials
3. Contact

To ease navigation, the header remains visible throughout.

### Bugs
#### Known bugs

##### Substack logo

There is no Substack logo in Fontawesome, so the site is using a [solid bookmark](https://fontawesome.com/icons/bookmark?f=classic&s=solid) as a placeholder for the time being.

Explore the option of either 

 - using the [official logo](https://substack.com/brand) as an image, OR
 - [creating a new icon on Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/use-kits/upload-icons) (requres a PRO account).

#### Solved bugs

##### Favicon not showing up

When placing the favicon files in the `assets/favicon` directory, the code provided on [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/books/) did not work, since it is written for the use case when files are placed in the root directory.

The code had to be modified to include the correct file paths for the favicon to show up correctly.
